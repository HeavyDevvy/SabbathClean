You are updating a working web app. Make ONLY the changes below. 
Do NOT change any other files, routes, API calls, state management, business logic, copy/wording, colors, fonts, layouts, or behaviors unless explicitly requested. 
Preserve all existing functionality and styling everywhere else.

====================
SCOPE OF CHANGES
====================

[HOME PAGE]

1) "Book services now"
- Fix so users can select their required service(s) as intended.
- After the “Add-ins & extras” page, clicking “Next” must NOT go to a blank screen; proceed to the next step in the flow.

2) "Watch how it works" (demo modal)
- Remove stage-by-stage clickability (no pseudo-clickable steps).
- Provide a single “Play Demo” control that plays the demo.
- Remove confusion where fields look clickable but do nothing.
- Fix “double close X” — there should be only ONE clear close icon.

[BOOKING A SPECIALIST]

3) Replace two buttons with one
- Remove “Book Now - advanced booking” and “Quick Quote & details”.
- Add ONE button instead: **“Quick Quote or Book Now”**.
- Clicking this launches the SAME popup/flow as before (merged).

[GENERAL CHANGES ACROSS BOOKING FLOW]

4) When service type is Emergency / Urgent / Same Day
- On the “Schedule & preferences” step:
  - The Preferred Date must default to TODAY and become read-only (user cannot change it).
  - This must apply across ALL services when Emergency/Urgent/Same Day is selected.
- For “Emergency” specifically:
  - Disable modern time preferences UI; auto-set to “As soon as possible” (read-only).

5) “Add-ons & extras” step enhancements
- Add a **free-text Comment field** (brief problem description).
- Convert Add-ons input into a **dropdown** that lists common issues/service add-ons per industry, each with **displayed pricing**.
- Implement **auto-suggest/auto-populate** of add-ons based on **keywords** found in the comment field. 
  - Create a keyword → add-on mapping per service/industry in a single config file (e.g., `config/addons.ts` or `.json`).
  - Users must still be able to manually pick additional add-ons.
- Add an **Hours** field that **auto-populates** based on an “industry standard hours per add-on/service” table.
  - Store these standards in a config file (e.g., `config/estimates.ts` or `.json`) and use them to prefill hours.
  - Put this disclaimer directly under Hours:
    “The time spent on site is subject to change once the service provider assesses the scope of work on-site.”
  - If you cannot fetch external data, seed the config with reasonable placeholders and a TODO comment to update.

6) “Choose your verified provider” step
- **Remove** the booking summary from this page.
- Provider names become **clickable**; clicking opens a **modal** with:
  - Provider photo
  - Rating
  - Distance from job address
  - Estimated arrival time
  - Bio (from the provider profile)
- Make this selection feel personal; do not alter underlying data models beyond reading existing provider info.

7) “Add another service” option (bottom of provider step)
- Add a control: **“Add another service”**.
- Clicking it returns the user to step 1 to choose an additional service.
- Prevent selecting the exact same service again in the same booking session (e.g., if House Cleaning was chosen, hide it for the second pick).
- Ensure the multi-service selection aggregates correctly through to payment.

[PAYMENT METHOD STEP]

8) Final booking summary
- Show a **clear breakdown** of all selected add-ons with **prices**.
- Add a dropdown above the total to **add more add-ons** at the last moment.
  - If the user adds more, update the summary breakdown and the total immediately.
- If the user added additional services earlier, show a **split breakdown** by service while summing to a single total.

9) Payment field validation
- Validate formats strictly:
  - Bank account number: numeric only; validate typical SA lengths (8–13 digits; use the selected bank to tune if there’s a per-bank rule in config).
  - CVV: 3 or 4 digits.
  - Expiry: MM/YY format.
- Add a **Select Bank** dropdown populated with major South African banks (no external calls; hardcode list in config):
  ["ABSA", "FNB", "Standard Bank", "Nedbank", "Capitec", "Investec", "African Bank", "TymeBank", "Discovery Bank", "Bidvest Bank", "Sasfin"].
- Use the selected bank to determine any stricter allowed account number patterns via config, but do not block payment if pattern is unknown; show friendly inline validation errors.

10) “Download report/receipt”
- Fix bug where multiple copies are downloaded.
- Ensure only **one** receipt is downloaded per click.
- Keep the report layout/fields the same but include **all add-ons** and multi-service line items in the receipt.

11) Calendar invite
- On the last step, next to “Share booking”, add: **“Add to Calendar”**.
- Clicking it should:
  - Generate a valid **.ics** invite containing: service title(s), provider, address, scheduled date/time, and notes for add-ons.
  - Send the invite via email to the **user’s registered email** (use existing email/send routine if present).
  - If no mailer exists, add a minimal server route using existing stack conventions and env vars (e.g., NODEMAILER) without breaking anything else.
  - Also provide a fallback **download .ics** link if email fails.
- Confirm this works end-to-end.

[LOGO CONSISTENCY]

12) Use the **same logo** shown on the Booking Confirmed page **everywhere** the logo appears in the app.
- Replace any mismatched header/footer/brand logos with this one.
- Size appropriately per context without distorting aspect ratio.

[PARITY BETWEEN ENTRY POINTS]

13) Ensure the **Services page “Book Now”** flow mirrors the updated Home page booking experience exactly (same validations, add-ons, hours, emergency handling, provider modal, summary, payment, calendar invite, etc.).

[CUSTOM SOLUTIONS]

14) Need a custom service solution
- On clicking **“Contact Us for Custom Solution”**, open a **popup** with a large description textarea where users can provide a detailed brief.
- Submit should use the existing contact/request channel; if none, add a minimal endpoint consistent with current backend patterns. Do not affect other areas.

[AUTH ON SERVICES PAGE]

15) Services page login state
- If the user is already authenticated, **do not** show “Sign in” or “Join as Provider” prompts on the Services page.
- Keep them logged in and proceed as normal.

====================
STRICT NON-GOALS
====================
- Do NOT change copy/wording anywhere except where a new button text was specified (“Quick Quote or Book Now”).
- Do NOT alter routes, API contracts, DB schemas, or global styles.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary for .ics email; if added, keep it minimal and scoped.
- Do NOT break or change existing flows outside the screens specified.

====================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
====================
- Centralize new configurable data in `/config` (e.g., addons, keyword map, hours estimates, banks & formats).
- Make all new UI additions accessible (labels, focus, aria).
- Keep all new styles scoped to the relevant components to avoid regressions.
- For keyword → add-on auto-suggest: trigger on debounce of comment field; show suggested item(s) pre-selected but allow user edits.
- For duplicate-service prevention in multi-service flow: compare service IDs; hide already-selected ones for the “Add another service” step only.

====================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
====================
- Home “Book services now” allows selection and proceeds past Add-ins to the next step with no blank screen.
- Demo modal has one close icon and one Play control (no dead clickable steps).
- Booking Specialist shows one button: “Quick Quote or Book Now”, launching the merged flow.
- Emergency/Urgent/Same Day set today’s date (read-only) and emergency locks time to “As soon as possible”.
- Add-ons dropdown + pricing + comment auto-suggest + hours auto-fill (with disclaimer) all working.
- Provider step has clickable names → modal with photo, rating, distance, ETA, bio. Summary removed from this step.
- “Add another service” loops back to start, cannot reselect identical service, aggregates to payment correctly.
- Final summary shows add-ons breakdown, allows adding more add-ons and updates totals live. Multi-service is split but totals summed.
- Payment validation enforces formats; SA banks dropdown present.
- Receipt downloads only once and includes add-ons/multi-service lines.
- “Add to Calendar” emails a valid .ics to the registered email (with fallback .ics download).
- The same logo from booking confirmation is used globally and sized correctly.
- Services page honors logged-in state (no sign-in/join prompts).
- Services page “Book Now” matches Home booking flow behavior.
- No other parts of the app are changed.
