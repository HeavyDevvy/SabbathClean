## 🔧 SabbathClean Platform Bug Fixes & Enhancements

**CRITICAL: Maintain all existing functionality. Do not break anything while implementing these changes.**

### **Priority 1: Main Page - Service Selection Fix**

**Issue:** On the main page where the "Book Service Now" button is located, services are displaying but not functioning when selected.

**Required Fix:**
- Make all service options clickable and fully functional
- When a service is selected, it should navigate the user to the actual service process menu for that specific service
- Ensure smooth navigation flow from main page → service selection → service process
- Test all service links to confirm they route correctly

### **Priority 2: Service-Specific Smart Suggestions**

**Issue:** In the "Add-ons & Extras - Customize your service with additional options" page, the Comments/Additional Details section shows example descriptions with smart suggestions, but the examples are generic and not contextual to the selected service.

**Required Fix:**
- Implement **dynamic, service-specific example descriptions** for the Comments/Additional Details field
- Examples should be contextually relevant to the service type:
  - **House Cleaning:** "Please focus on the kitchen and bathrooms. Use eco-friendly products."
  - **Laundry Service:** "Separate whites from colors. Use fabric softener on towels only."
  - **Ironing Service:** "Extra starch on shirts. Delicate setting for silk items."
  - **Carpet Cleaning:** "High-traffic areas near entrance need extra attention. Pet-friendly products preferred."
  - (Add appropriate examples for all other services)
- Ensure smart suggestions adapt based on the currently selected service

### **Priority 3: Multi-Service Booking & Unified Payment**

**Issue:** Customers can only book one service at a time. Need ability to add multiple services before checkout.

**Required Implementation:**

#### A. **"Choose Your Provider" Page Enhancement:**
- After a customer selects a provider for their first service, display an option: **"Add Another Service"** button
- Allow customers to add **up to 3 services maximum** before proceeding to payment
- Each added service should go through its own:
  - Service customization (add-ons, extras)
  - Comments/details
  - Provider selection
  
#### B. **Service Management Features:**
- Display a summary/cart showing all selected services
- Allow users to review, edit, or remove services before payment
- Show a running total that updates as services are added/removed

#### C. **Unified Payment Page:**
- Create a **single consolidated payment page** that accounts for all selected services (up to 3)
- Display:
  - Itemized list of all services with individual prices
  - Service details for each (date, time, provider, add-ons)
  - Subtotal for each service
  - **Grand Total** for all services combined
- Process payment once for all services
- Generate a single confirmation with all booking details

### **Testing Requirements:**

Before marking as complete, verify:

✅ All services on main page are clickable and route correctly  
✅ Smart suggestions change dynamically based on service type  
✅ Multi-service flow works smoothly (add up to 3 services)  
✅ Payment page correctly calculates total for multiple services  
✅ All existing functionality remains intact  
✅ No broken links or navigation issues  
✅ Responsive design maintained across all pages  
✅ Database properly stores multi-service bookings  

---

### **Implementation Notes:**

- Use modular code to avoid duplication
- Ensure backend handles multi-service transactions atomically
- Maintain consistent UI/UX across all service flows
- Add proper error handling for edge cases
- Preserve all current styling and branding

---

**Please implement these changes incrementally, testing after each major change to ensure nothing breaks. Provide status updates for each priority section.**
