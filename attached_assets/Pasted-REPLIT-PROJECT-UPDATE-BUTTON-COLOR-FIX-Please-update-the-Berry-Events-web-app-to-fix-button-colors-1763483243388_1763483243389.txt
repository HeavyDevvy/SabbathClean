Hover state colors → Match "Watch how it works" button
Border colors (if any) → Match "Watch how it works" button


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: Identify the Reference Styling
1. Locate the "Watch how it works" button in the code
2. Find its CSS class, styled-component, or inline styles
3. Note all color-related properties:
   - background-color or background
   - color (text color)
   - border-color
   - Hover/active state colors
   - Any color variables used (e.g., var(--primary-color))
Step 2: Find ALL Target Buttons
1. Search the entire project for "Quick quote or Book Now" (or similar text)
2. Search for the Berry Stars "Book Now" button
3. Make a list of ALL file locations where these buttons appear
4. Note: There may be multiple instances - update EVERY ONE
Step 3: Apply the Color Styling
Option A (Recommended): Apply the same CSS class
- Add the same class used by "Watch how it works" to target buttons
- This ensures consistency

Option B: Copy color properties
- Copy all color-related CSS from "Watch how it works" button
- Apply to each target button's styling
- Include normal, hover, active, and focus states
Step 4: Handle All States
Ensure you update colors for:

- :focus state
- :disabled state (if applicable)

 Check Berry Stars "Book Now" button matches this color
 Test hover effect on each updated button
 Colors match EXACTLY (use color picker tool if needed)

Functional Verification:

 No broken links
 No layout shifts or breaks
 Buttons are still visible and readable

Technical Verification:

 Open browser DevTools Console
 Check for any error messages (should be ZERO errors)
 Refresh the page - no blank screens
 Test on different pages - no blank screens
 Check mobile/responsive view - buttons still visible

Page-by-Page Check:

 Homepage - all buttons checked
 Services/Service tiles - all buttons checked

 Any other pages with these buttons - all checked


TROUBLESHOOTING
If colors don't change:

Check CSS specificity - add !important if needed

css   background-color: #your-color !important;

Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
Check if inline styles are overriding your CSS
Verify you're editing the correct CSS file
Check for CSS-in-JS or styled-components syntax

If you can't find a button:

Use global search (Ctrl+Shift+F)
Search for partial text like "book now" or "quick quote"
Check if buttons are dynamically generated
Look in configuration files or data arrays

If errors appear:

Check browser console for specific error messages
Verify CSS syntax (no missing semicolons or brackets)
Ensure color values are valid (hex, rgb, or CSS color names)
Revert last change and try a different approach

If blank screen appears:

Check console for JavaScript errors
Verify you didn't accidentally delete or break code
Check for syntax errors in CSS-in-JS
Revert to last working version


EXAMPLE CODE REFERENCE
If "Watch how it works" uses a class:
css.watch-button {
  background-color: #4A90E2;
  color: #FFFFFF;
}
.watch-button:hover {
  background-color: #357ABD;
}
Then apply to other buttons:
html<!-- Add the same class -->
<button className="watch-button">Quick quote or Book Now</button>

<!-- OR copy the CSS -->
<button className="quick-quote-btn">Quick quote or Book Now</button>
css.quick-quote-btn {
  background-color: #4A90E2;
  color: #FFFFFF;
}
.quick-quote-btn:hover {
  background-color: #357ABD;
}
