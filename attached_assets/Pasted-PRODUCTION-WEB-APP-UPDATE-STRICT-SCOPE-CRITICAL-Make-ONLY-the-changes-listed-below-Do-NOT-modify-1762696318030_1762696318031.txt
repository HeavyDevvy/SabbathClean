PRODUCTION WEB APP UPDATE - STRICT SCOPE
CRITICAL: Make ONLY the changes listed below. Do NOT modify any other logic, routes, APIs, copy, layouts, styles, or components. Zero regressions, zero console errors.

A) FIX SERVICE SELECTION FLOW
Issue: When user selects a service on "Choose a Service" page, the wrong booking popup opens (defaults to House Cleaning or nothing happens).
Fix Required:

Ensure the selected service immediately opens the CORRECT booking popup/flow for that specific service
Fix the selection handler - do NOT change route names or state structure
Test all 8 services to confirm each opens its own booking flow


B) MULTI-SERVICE BOOKING (UP TO 3 SERVICES)
On "Choose Verified Provider" step, add:

"Add Another Service" button at bottom of page
Clicking returns user to service selection (step 1)
Previously selected services must be hidden/disabled (prevent duplicates)
Maximum 3 services per booking session
Aggregate costs from all selected services + their providers
Payment Summary must show:

Line-by-line breakdown by service
Each service's provider cost + add-ons
Grand total (sum of all services)



State Management:

Track array of selected services in booking flow
Pass accumulated costs through each step
Validate max 3 services before allowing "Add Another"


C) SCHEDULE & PREFERENCES - STABILITY CHECK ONLY
DO NOT change any text, labels, or existing fields.
Only fix if broken:

Ensure step renders correctly for all 8 services (no blank screens)
Fix any navigation/state issues that prevent progression
Keep changes isolated to this step only


D) NEW ADD-ONS WITH PRICING + KEYWORD AUTO-SUGGEST
1. Create /config/addons.json with this structure:

    "addons": [
      {

        "label": "Deep cleaning (ovens, fridges, cupboards)",
        "priceZAR": 650,
        "keywords": ["deep clean", "oven", "fridge", "cupboard", "kitchen deep"]
