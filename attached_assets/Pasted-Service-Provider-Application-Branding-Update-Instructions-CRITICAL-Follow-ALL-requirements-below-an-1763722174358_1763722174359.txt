Service Provider Application Branding Update Instructions
CRITICAL: Follow ALL requirements below and commit changes properly
1. Colour Scheme Implementation
Apply ONLY the Berry Events colour palette throughout the Join as Provider / Service Provider Application flow:
Colour Palette (use EXACT hex codes):

#44062D – primary dark (headers, primary buttons, key accents)
#3C0920 – secondary dark (hover states, borders, secondary sections)
#EED1C4 – warm cream (cards, input backgrounds, secondary sections)
#F7F2EF – soft off-white (main page background)
#C56B86 – muted rose accent (links, highlights, badges)

Requirements:

Remove ALL old blues, purples, or non-palette colours
Update: buttons, CTAs, step indicators, text links, form labels, backgrounds, borders
Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance (minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components)
Test hover states, focus states, and active states with palette colours only

2. Logo and Branding

Add Berry Events logo to the top of Service Provider Application page
Position in header/top section with consistent alignment matching main app pages
Ensure responsive scaling (no stretching or pixelation)
Test on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1920px) viewports
Logo should load properly without broken image errors

3. Stepper/Progress Indicator Styling
Step indicator colours:

Active step: #44062D
Completed steps: #C56B86
Inactive steps: #F7F2EF background with #3C0920 text

Requirements:

Match existing app typography (font-family, sizes, weights)
Match border-radius, shadows, and spacing from global styles
Ensure no overlapping text or misaligned icons on any screen size
Test step transitions and visual feedback

4. Consistency Standards
Match existing app styling:

Typography: same font-family, font-sizes, font-weights, line-heights
Border radius: use existing values from global theme
Shadows: apply existing box-shadow values
Button styles: match padding, hover effects, transitions, focus rings
Input fields: match height, padding, border styles, focus states
Spacing: use existing margin/padding scale (likely 4px/8px grid)

DO NOT change:

Any form validation logic
Field requirements or data structure
Navigation logic between steps
API calls or data submission

5. Error Prevention & Testing
Before committing, verify:

 No console errors or warnings
 No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
 All steps load correctly without blank screens
 Navigation between steps works as before
 All imports and component references are correct
 Images/assets load properly (logo, icons)
 Forms submit successfully
 Validation messages display correctly with new colours
 Success/confirmation screens render properly

Test on:

Chrome, Firefox, Safari
Mobile viewport (375px)
Tablet viewport (768px)
Desktop viewport (1920px+)

6. Implementation Checklist
Step-by-step process:

Create a new branch: git checkout -b branding-update-service-provider
Locate all Service Provider Application component files
Update colour variables in theme/CSS files first
Apply colours to components systematically (one step at a time)
Add logo to header component
Update stepper component styling
Test each page/step after updating
Fix any console errors immediately
Verify responsive behavior on all screen sizes
Run final checklist (Section 5 above)

7. Git Workflow (MANDATORY)
After completing changes:
bash# Check what changed
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Update Service Provider Application branding to Berry Events colour palette"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin branding-update-service-provider

# Verify push succeeded
git log --oneline -n 1
If errors occur:

Re-commit and push

8. Files Likely to Modify
Look for these files/folders:

/components/ServiceProvider/**
/pages/join-provider/** or similar
/styles/theme.css or /styles/variables.css
/components/Stepper/**
Any provider-specific layout components

DO NOT modify:

Unrelated app pages
API routes (unless fixing import paths)
Database schemas
Authentication logic

9. Final Verification
Before marking complete, confirm:

 All Service Provider Application pages use ONLY specified colour palette
 Logo displays correctly at top of all provider pages
 Stepper uses correct colours for active/completed/inactive states
 No visual inconsistencies with rest of Berry Events app
 Navigation flows work identically to before
 No console errors in browser dev tools
 All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
 Can successfully complete full provider application flow

Success criteria:
The Join as Provider / Service Provider Application should look like a seamless part of the Berry Events application with consistent branding, colours, and visual styling throughout.
