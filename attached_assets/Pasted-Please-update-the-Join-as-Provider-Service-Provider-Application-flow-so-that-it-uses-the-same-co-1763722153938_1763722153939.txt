Please update the “Join as Provider” / Service Provider Application flow so that it uses the same colour scheme and branding as the rest of the Berry Events application.

1. Colour scheme

Apply ONLY the Berry Events colour palette throughout the Join as Provider / Service Provider Application views (including all pages, modals, and step components):
	•	#44062D – primary dark (main brand colour for headers, primary buttons, key accents)
	•	#3C0920 – secondary dark (hover states, secondary sections, borders where needed)
	•	#EED1C4 – warm cream (cards, input backgrounds, secondary sections)
	•	#F7F2EF – soft off-white (main page background)
	•	#C56B86 – muted rose accent (links, highlights, subtle accents and badges)

Requirements:
	•	Remove any old blues, purples, or other colours that are not part of this palette.
	•	Update all buttons, CTAs, step indicators, text links, form labels, and backgrounds in the Join as Provider flow to use only the above colours.
	•	Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (especially on buttons and smaller text).

2. Logo and branding
	•	Add the Berry Events logo (use the logo image uploaded with this prompt) to the top of the Service Provider Application page.
	•	The logo should sit in the header or top section, aligned consistently with the rest of the app (same alignment and spacing as on the main/home pages).
	•	Make sure the logo scales correctly on different screen sizes and does not appear stretched or pixelated.

3. Stepper / progress alignment

For the multi-step “Join as Provider” / Service Provider Application process:
	•	Style the stepper/progress indicator using the Berry Events colour palette:
	•	Active step: use #44062D as the primary highlight.
	•	Completed steps: use #C56B86 or another suitable accent from the palette.
	•	Inactive steps: use a muted tone (e.g. #F7F2EF background with #3C0920 text).
	•	Make sure the step titles, numbers/icons, and connecting lines all visually align with the rest of the app’s styling (same fonts, font sizes, border radius, etc.).
	•	Ensure spacing and alignment are consistent across desktop and mobile (no overlapping text or misaligned icons).

4. Consistency with the rest of the app
	•	Match the typography (font family, font sizes, font weights) already used in the main app.
	•	Match border radius, shadows, and button styles to the existing global style used elsewhere (e.g. same rounded corners, hover behaviour, and focus states).
	•	Do not change any logic or form fields – this update is purely for styling and branding unless fixing obvious UI bugs.

5. Error handling and blank screens
	•	Make sure there are no JavaScript/TypeScript errors, styling errors, or console errors introduced by these changes.
	•	The Join as Provider / Service Provider Application flow must:
	•	Load correctly on every step.
	•	Not show any blank screens or unresolved components.
	•	Successfully navigate between steps as before.
	•	If any imports, components, or assets were renamed during the update, ensure all references are correctly updated.

6. Final checks

Before finishing, please:
	•	Double-check that every part of the Join as Provider / Service Provider Application (all steps, success/confirmation screens, error states, and validation messages) uses only the specified colour palette and shows the logo at the top.
	•	Confirm that navigation through the steps still works exactly as before (no broken routes or missing components).
	•	Confirm there are no console errors or warnings related to the updated components.

Do not modify any unrelated parts of the app – limit all changes to the Join as Provider / Service Provider Application screens and shared styling/theme files if necessary.
