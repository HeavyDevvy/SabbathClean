---

### 3. COLOUR SCHEME & STYLING

**Use ONLY these colours from your existing app:**

Based on your app's colour scheme:
- `#44062D` – Deep plum (primary dark) - for headings/text
- `#3C0920` – Wine/berry (secondary dark) - for borders
- `#EED1C4` – Warm cream - for backgrounds/sections
- `#F7F2EF` – Soft off-white - for modal background
- `#C56B86` – Muted rose accent - for buttons/CTAs

**Apply these colours to:**
- Modal background: `#F7F2EF`
- Modal overlay (backdrop): `rgba(68, 6, 45, 0.5)` (transparent plum)
- Heading text: `#44062D`
- Body text/labels: `#3C0920`
- Input borders: `#EED1C4` (normal) and `#C56B86` (focused)
- Submit button background: `#C56B86`
- Submit button text: `#F7F2EF`
- Submit button hover: Slightly darker `#C56B86` (use opacity or darken 10%)
- Character counter: `#3C0920`
- Error messages: `#C56B86` (to indicate validation issues)

**Styling requirements:**
- Match the existing app's font family
- Match the existing app's button style (rounded corners, padding, shadows if any)
- Input fields should have consistent padding and spacing
- Modal should have rounded corners matching existing UI
- Form should be clean, spacious, not cramped

---

### 4. FORM VALIDATION

**Client-side validation (before submission):**

For each field, validate:

1. **Name:**
   - Not empty
   - Show error: "Name is required"

2. **Surname:**
   - Not empty
   - Show error: "Surname is required"

3. **Email:**
   - Not empty
   - Valid email format (contains @ and domain)
   - Show error: "Valid email address is required"

4. **Contact Number:**
   - Not empty
   - At least 10 characters
   - Only contains valid phone characters
   - Show error: "Valid contact number is required (min 10 digits)"

5. **Description:**
   - Not empty
   - At least 10 characters
   - Max 500 characters (enforced)
   - Show error: "Description must be between 10 and 500 characters"

**Validation behavior:**
- Show error messages below each field when user leaves field (onBlur)
- Submit button is disabled if any field is invalid
- Errors clear when user corrects the input
- All errors must be visible before allowing submission

---

### 5. EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY

**When form is valid and user clicks "Send to Berry Team":**

#### A. Prepare Email Data
Collect all form data:
```javascript
{
  name: "[user's name]",
  surname: "[user's surname]",
  email: "[user's email]",
  contactNumber: "[user's contact number]",
  description: "[user's description]"
}
```

#### B. Email Details
Send an email to: **support@berryevents.co.za**

**Email subject:**
"New Custom Solution Request from [Name] [Surname]"

**Email body (formatted nicely):**
```
Custom Solution Request

Name: [Name] [Surname]
Email: [Email]
Contact Number: [Contact Number]

Description:
[Description]

---
Submitted from Berry Events Website
Date: [Current date and time]
```

#### C. Implementation Options

**Option 1 - Using EmailJS (Recommended for frontend-only):**
1. Set up a free EmailJS account
2. Add EmailJS SDK to your project
3. Configure email template
4. Send email using EmailJS service
5. Add TODO comment: "EmailJS service ID and template ID need to be configured with support@berryevents.co.za"

**Option 2 - Backend API endpoint:**
1. Create an API endpoint (if you have backend)
2. Use nodemailer or similar
3. Send POST request to API with form data
4. API sends email

**Option 3 - Placeholder (if no email service available):**
1. Log the data to console
2. Store in memory/localStorage
3. Add clear TODO comment: "EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY NOT IMPLEMENTED - Integrate with email service to send to support@berryevents.co.za"
4. Still show success message to user

**Choose the option that works with your current setup. Document your choice clearly in comments.**

---

### 6. SUCCESS MESSAGE & REDIRECT

**After successful submission:**

#### A. Close the form modal

#### B. Show success popup with:
- Icon: ✓ checkmark (green or using `#C56B86`)
- Heading: "Thank You!"
- Message: "Your custom solution request has been received. Our Berry team will be in touch shortly."
- Auto-close timer: 3 seconds
- Or manual close button: "OK"

#### C. After success popup closes:
- Redirect user to homepage (if not already on homepage, refresh the page)
- Clear the form data
- Reset form validation states

#### D. Success popup styling:
- Use same colour scheme as form modal
- Centered on screen
- Clean and simple design
- Matches existing app UI style

---

### 7. ERROR HANDLING

**If email submission fails:**

Show error popup:
- Heading: "Oops!"
- Message: "Something went wrong. Please try again or contact us directly at support@berryevents.co.za"
- Button: "Try Again" (reopens the form with data preserved)
- Button: "Close"

**Log error to console:**
- Full error details for debugging
- Don't show technical error details to user

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

**Finding the button:**
```javascript
// Search for text like:
"Contact Us for Custom Solutions"
// or similar button labels
```

**Creating the modal:**
```javascript
// Use state to control modal visibility
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

// Button onClick
onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}
```

**Form validation:**
```javascript
// Use controlled inputs with state
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: '',
  surname: '',
  email: '',
  contactNumber: '',
  description: ''
});

const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

// Validate on blur or on submit
```

**Character counter:**
```javascript
// Show current length vs max
{formData.description.length}/500 characters
```

**Email sending (EmailJS example):**
```javascript
// Install: npm install @emailjs/browser
import emailjs from '@emailjs/browser';

emailjs.send(
  'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',
  'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',
  formData,
  'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
);
```

## ⚡ TROUBLESHOOTING

**If modal doesn't open:**
- Check button onClick handler is calling the right function
- Check modal state is updating
- Check modal component is rendering conditionally

**If validation doesn't work:**
- Check each validation function returns boolean
- Check error messages are rendering
- Check submit button disabled state

**If colours don't match:**
- Use browser DevTools to inspect existing buttons
- Copy exact hex codes from existing elements
- Apply same Tailwind classes if using Tailwind

**If email doesn't send:**
- Check EmailJS configuration
- Check API endpoint if using backend
- Check console for error messages
- Use placeholder method if needed
