TASK: Update the downloaded booking receipt/summary PDF styling in the Berry Events web app.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP - LOCATE THE RECEIPT CODE:
Before making any changes, you MUST:
1. Search the entire codebase for receipt/PDF generation code
2. Look for these common patterns:
   - Files named: receipt.js, invoice.js, pdf.js, generateReceipt, downloadReceipt, etc.
   - Libraries: jsPDF, pdfmake, react-pdf, pdfkit, html2pdf, etc.
   - Functions named: generatePDF, createReceipt, downloadReceipt, printReceipt, etc.
   - API endpoints: /api/receipt, /api/booking/receipt, /download-receipt, etc.
3. Search for these strings in the code: "download", "receipt", "PDF", "jsPDF", "pdfmake"
4. Check these common locations:
   - /src/components/ (React components)
   - /src/utils/ (utility functions)
   - /src/services/ (API services)
   - /api/ or /server/ (backend routes)
   - Any booking or checkout related files

RESPOND FIRST: Tell me where you found the receipt generation code (file path and line numbers) before making any changes.

ONCE YOU'VE LOCATED THE CODE, MAKE THESE CHANGES:

1. UPDATE THE HEADER SECTION OF THE PDF:

   a) Background color:
      - Find where the PDF header/top section is created
      - Set its background color to match the app header color
      - The app header color is likely defined in your CSS/theme files
      - Common locations: styles.css, theme.js, or CSS variables like --header-bg

   b) Add the logo:
      - Import/reference the logo image file used in the app header
      - If using jsPDF: Use .addImage() method
      - If using pdfmake: Add the image to the content array
      - If using html2pdf: Add an <img> tag in the HTML template
      - Position: Top-left or centered
      - Ensure the image path is correct and accessible
      - Size appropriately (e.g., 50x50px or similar to header logo size)

   c) Add "Berry Events" text:
      - Place next to or below the logo
      - Use the same font, size, and color as the app header
      - If custom fonts are needed, ensure they're loaded in the PDF library

2. PRESERVE ALL DATA:
   - Do NOT change any booking details, prices, dates, customer info, etc.
   - Only update visual styling (colors, fonts, spacing, logo placement)

3. TEST THE DOWNLOAD:
   - After making changes, trigger a test booking download
   - Verify the PDF generates without errors
   - Check that the new styling appears correctly
   - Ensure all data is still present and accurate

DEBUGGING TIPS IF CHANGES DON'T APPEAR:

If the receipt still looks the same after your changes:

1. Check browser cache:
   - The old PDF might be cached
   - Clear browser cache or open in incognito/private mode
   - Add a cache-busting parameter to the PDF filename

2. Verify the correct file was modified:
   - There might be multiple receipt generation functions
   - Search for all instances of receipt/PDF generation
   - Make sure you modified the one that's actually being called

3. Check for build/compilation:
   - If using a build process, ensure the app was rebuilt after changes
   - Restart the development server if needed

4. Add console.logs:
   - Add console.log statements in the receipt generation function
   - Verify the function is being called when downloading
   - Log the styling values to confirm they're being applied

5. Check for errors:
   - Open browser console (F12) when downloading the receipt
   - Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings
   - Check network tab for failed image/resource loads

SPECIFIC CODE EXAMPLES:

If using jsPDF:
```javascript
// Add this to your receipt generation code
const doc = new jsPDF();

// Add logo (update path to your logo)
doc.addImage('/path/to/logo.png', 'PNG', 10, 10, 50, 50);

// Add colored header background
doc.setFillColor(YOUR_HEADER_COLOR); // e.g., (66, 135, 245) for blue
doc.rect(0, 0, 210, 40, 'F'); // Full-width colored rectangle

// Add "Berry Events" text
doc.setFontSize(24);
doc.setTextColor(255, 255, 255); // White text
doc.text('Berry Events', 70, 30);
```

If using pdfmake:
```javascript
const docDefinition = {
  content: [
    {
      columns: [
        { image: 'data:image/png;base64,...', width: 50 }, // Your logo
        { text: 'Berry Events', fontSize: 24, color: '#ffffff' }
      ],
      margin: [0, 0, 0, 20]
    },
    // ... rest of your receipt content
  ],
  background: {
    canvas: [
      {
        type: 'rect',
        x: 0, y: 0,
        w: 595, h: 60,
        color: 'YOUR_HEADER_COLOR'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT:

Please respond with:
1. "I found the receipt generation code at: [FILE PATH]"
2. "The method being used is: [jsPDF/pdfmake/other]"
3. Then make the changes and confirm: "Changes applied. Please test by downloading a receipt."

If you cannot find the receipt generation code, respond:
"I cannot locate the receipt generation code. I searched in [list locations]. Please provide the file path manually."
