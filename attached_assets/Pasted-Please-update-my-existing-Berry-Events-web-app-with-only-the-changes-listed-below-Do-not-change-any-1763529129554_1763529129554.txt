Please update my existing Berry Events web app with only the changes listed below.
Do not change anything else in the project.
Make sure there are no error codes and no blank screens once the changes are made.

⸻

1. Header: keep “Join as Provider” button, remove “Service provider?” text
	•	In the header/navigation bar:
	•	Keep the existing “Join as Provider” button exactly as it is (same position, style, and behaviour).
	•	Remove only the text that appears next to it and says “Service provider?”.
	•	After removing the text:
	•	Adjust the spacing so there is no awkward gap where the text used to be.
	•	Ensure all header items (logo, nav links, “Join as Provider” button, etc.) remain neatly aligned and evenly spaced.

2. Replace logo with the uploaded image
	•	Replace the current logo in the header with the uploaded logo image (the image provided with this prompt).
	•	The logo must appear:
	•	In the header.
	•	Anywhere else in the app where the main logo is displayed (for example: homepage, footer, other pages with the same header component), using the same new image.

Background & borders:
	•	The logo should not appear inside a visible box or with a different background colour.
	•	Ensure the logo’s background:
	•	Matches the background of the section it appears in.
	•	For example:
	•	In the header, the logo background must blend with the header background colour (no white box or border around it).
	•	If needed, remove any CSS that adds:
	•	Background colour behind the logo image.
	•	Borders or box-shadows around the logo container.
	•	The logo should look naturally integrated into the header and other sections.

3. Consistent header styling across all pages
	•	Make sure the header colour, logo size, text size, and text style are consistent across all pages in the web app where a header appears.
	•	Same:
	•	Header background colour
	•	Logo size and placement
	•	Font family, font size, font weight, and text colour for navigation/header text
	•	“Join as Provider” button style
	•	If multiple header components or layouts exist, update them so they all match the main header style (the one on the main/home/My Profile pages).
	•	The goal: the user should see one consistent header design everywhere.

4. Update the downloaded receipt design
	•	Find the downloaded receipt (PDF or file) that users can download after a booking/payment.

Update it as follows:
	1.	Colour scheme:
	•	Change the receipt’s colours to match the app’s colour scheme (use the same primary/secondary colours already used in the app’s UI).
	•	Remove any default or mismatched colours so the receipt looks like part of the Berry Events brand.
	2.	Add the logo:
	•	Add the same new logo image (uploaded logo) to the downloaded receipt.
	•	Place it appropriately at the top (e.g. top-left or centred), in a way that looks professional.
	•	Ensure the logo:
	•	Is sized correctly (not pixelated, not too large or too small).
	•	Has no visible box or different background colour around it (blend with the receipt background similar to other sections).
	3.	Typography:
	•	Use the same or similar font style and sizing as used in the app for headings/body text where practical.
	•	Ensure the receipt remains easy to read and clearly structured.

5. Quality checks

Before completing, please verify:
	1.	The “Join as Provider” button is still in the header and works as before.
	2.	The “Service provider?” text has been removed, and header spacing still looks clean.
	3.	The new logo:
	•	Appears everywhere the logo is used.
	•	Has no visible border/box.
	•	Has a background that matches the section it appears in (especially in the header).
	4.	The header:
	•	Has a consistent background colour, logo size, and text styling across all pages.
	5.	The downloaded receipt:
	•	Uses the same colour scheme as the app.
	•	Includes the new logo, sized correctly and visually clean.
	6.	The app runs with:
	•	No error codes in the console
	•	No blank screens
	•	No broken layouts or navigation

Please implement only the changes described above and keep everything else exactly as it is.
