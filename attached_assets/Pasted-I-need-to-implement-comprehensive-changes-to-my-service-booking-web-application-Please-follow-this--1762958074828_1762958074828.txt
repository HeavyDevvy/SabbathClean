I need to implement comprehensive changes to my service booking web application. Please follow this detailed phased approach, testing thoroughly after EACH feature implementation.

**PHASE 1: AUTHENTICATION & SESSION PERSISTENCE**

**Task 1.1: Fix User Session Management**
- Implement proper session storage that persists across page navigation
- When user logs in, store authentication token in localStorage/sessionStorage
- On every page load, check for existing auth token and set user as logged in
- Update navigation header to conditionally render:
  - If user NOT logged in: Show "Sign In" button
  - If user IS logged in: Show user profile dropdown with options (My Profile, My Bookings, Logout)
- Test: Login → Navigate to multiple pages → Verify user remains logged in

**Task 1.2: Authentication Flow for Bookings**
- When user tries to access booking steps without being logged in:
  - Show modal/popup with:
    - Email input field
    - Password input field  
    - "Sign In" button
    - "Don't have an account? Sign Up" button
  - "Sign Up" button redirects to full signup page
  - After successful signin/signup, redirect user back to booking process at the exact step they were on
  - Preserve all booking data entered before authentication interrupt

**PHASE 2: HOME PAGE ENHANCEMENTS**

**Task 2.1: Book Now Service Flow**
- Update "Book Now" button modal to show ONLY these services:
  - House Cleaning
  - Plumbing Service  
  - Electrical Services
  - Garden Care
  - Chef & Catering
  - Waitering Services
  - Moving Services
  - Au Pair Service
- REMOVE "Handyman" service completely
- Each service click should redirect to specific booking process:
  - "Au Pair Service" → `/booking/au-pair/step-1`
  - "House Cleaning" → `/booking/house-cleaning/step-1`
  - etc. for each service
- Test each service redirects to correct booking flow

**Task 2.2: Demo Video Popup Enhancement**
- Increase popup dimensions to minimum 800px width × 600px height
- Ensure all content fits without vertical scrolling:
  - Video player (visible without scrolling)
  - "Play Demo" button (visible)
  - Process flow description (fully visible)
  - Close button (visible)
- Make popup responsive but ensure no content is cut off on standard screen sizes

**Task 2.3: Custom Service Solution Implementation**
- Create modal/popup with form containing:
  - Name Surname (text input, required)
  - Email address (email input, required) 
  - Contact Number (tel input, required)
  - Description (textarea, maxlength=500, required)
- Form validation: All fields mandatory
- Submit button: "Send to Berry Team"
- On submit:
  - Send form data to backend API endpoint
  - Show success popup: "Thank you for your request!"
  - Redirect to homepage after 2 seconds
  - Email sent to: support@berryevents.co.za

**PHASE 3: BOOKING PROCESS REDESIGN**

**Task 3.1: Service-Specific Booking Fields**
- Review each service booking form and ensure fields are relevant:
  - House Cleaning: square footage, cleaning type, pets, etc.
  - Plumbing: issue type, emergency, location access, etc.
  - Electrical: problem description, power outage, etc.
  - Au Pair: children ages, hours needed, languages, etc.
- Maintain consistency: Common fields (address, contact info) should be in same order across all services

**Task 3.2: Conditional Scheduling Fields**
- Property type selection should show/hide gate code field:
  - If "Townhouse" or "Apartment" selected → Show "Gate Code" input field
  - If "House" selected → Hide "Gate Code" field
- Implement proper field toggle logic

**Task 3.3: Add-Ons System**
- Create service-specific add-ons with pricing:
  - House Cleaning: Deep cleaning (+R200), Window cleaning (+R150), etc.
  - Plumbing: Emergency fee (+R300), Weekend service (+R200), etc.
  - Electrical: Additional outlets (+R150), Ceiling fan installation (+R400), etc.
- Each add-on should have:
  - Checkbox for selection
  - Clear price display
  - Real-time total price calculation
- Test: Select add-ons → Verify price updates correctly

**Task 3.4: Remove Payment Step & Cart Integration**
- Remove payment information collection from booking process
- Final booking step should show:
  - "Add to Cart" button (adds service to cart, stays on page)
  - "Go to Cart" button (redirects to cart page)
- Cart should display:
  - Service name, date, time, provider, add-ons, total price
  - "Remove" option for each item
  - "Proceed to Payment" button

**PHASE 4: CART & USER PROFILE MANAGEMENT**

**Task 4.1: Cart Persistence & Automation**
- Implement cart storage that persists for 14 days
- Cart data structure should include:
  - Service details, selected add-ons, pricing, booking datetime
  - Timestamp for expiration tracking
- Automated reminder system:
  - After 3 days: In-app notification "Complete your booking!"
  - After 7 days: Email reminder "Your cart items are waiting"
  - After 12 days: Final reminder "Bookings expire in 2 days"

**Task 4.2: User Profile Restructure**
- Rename "Profile and settings" to "Profile and preferences"
- Add new "Settings" tab with:
  - Light/Dark mode toggle
  - Privacy settings (data sharing preferences, notification preferences)
- Ensure all existing profile functionality remains unchanged

**Task 4.3: My Bookings Enhancements**

**Reschedule Functionality:**
- "Reschedule" button opens calendar popup
- Show service provider availability (gray out unavailable dates)
- Limit selection to 2-week window from closest Monday
- Update booking with new date/time

**Cancellation Process:**
- "Cancel" button opens cancellation popup with:
  - Reason selection (dropdown: "Found alternative", "No longer needed", "Price", "Other")
  - Cancellation policy in BOLD RED text:
    "10% cancellation fee deducted from amount paid"
    "50% fee if cancelled 4 days or sooner before booking"  
    "NO REFUND if cancelled 24 hours before booking"
  - Consent checkbox: "I understand and accept the cancellation terms"
  - "Confirm Cancellation" button (disabled until checkbox checked)
- On confirmation: Move booking to "Past Bookings" section

**Past Bookings Features:**
- "Re-book this service" button that:
  - Pre-populates all booking fields from previous booking
  - EXCEPT: Date and time fields remain empty for new selection
  - ALL fields remain editable even though pre-populated
- "Share Booking" button that:
  - Generates unique shareable link
  - Link redirects to booking form with all service details pre-populated
  - EXCEPT: User details, address, service date/time remain empty

**PHASE 5: WALLET & BERRY STARS FIXES**

**Task 5.1: Currency Conversion & Wallet UI**
- Find ALL currency displays throughout application and change $ to R
- Update currency formatting: R 1,000.00 (South African Rand format)
- Add "Close" button (X) in top-right corner of wallet popup
- Ensure all wallet functions work: View balance, transaction history, etc.

**Task 5.2: Berry Stars Booking Flow Correction**
- When user selects provider from Berry Stars section:
  - Redirect to booking process for that provider's service
  - SKIP the "Choose your verified provider" step (Step 4)
  - Automatically pre-select the chosen provider
  - Show confirmation: "Booking with [Provider Name]"
  - Continue with remaining booking steps normally

**IMPLEMENTATION & TESTING PROTOCOL:**

**For EACH feature:**
1. Implement the code changes
2. Test the functionality thoroughly
