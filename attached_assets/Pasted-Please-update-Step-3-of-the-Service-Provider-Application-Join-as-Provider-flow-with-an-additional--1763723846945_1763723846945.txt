Please update Step 3 of the Service Provider Application (Join as Provider flow) with an additional document upload section for a Profile Picture.

1. Add a profile picture upload section

On Step 3 (where the other documents are uploaded):
	•	Add a new upload block titled: “Profile picture”.
	•	This block must:
	•	Allow the service provider to upload an image from their device.
	•	Give them the option to take a photo with their camera, exactly the same way the other document upload sections work.
	•	Use the same component, layout, and behaviour as the existing document upload inputs (copy the same upload/take-photo logic and UI, but change the label and accepted file type if needed).
	•	Accept common image formats (e.g. .jpg, .jpeg, .png).

2. Behaviour & validation
	•	Treat the Profile picture as a separate document in the form state and submission payload.
	•	Use the same validation pattern as the other uploads:
	•	If other documents are required, make this profile picture required as well (or follow the same required/optional logic currently used for the other docs).
	•	Show clear error messages if upload fails or is missing (following the same style as existing document errors).
	•	Ensure the uploaded/taken profile picture is:
	•	Properly stored in the form state.
	•	Included in whatever data is sent to the backend / API for the Service Provider Application, in a clearly named field (e.g. profilePicture or profile_image), consistent with the current naming conventions.

3. UI & styling
	•	The new Profile picture section must visually match the existing document upload sections:
	•	Same spacing, borders, fonts, buttons, icons, and hover/focus states.
	•	Same “Upload” and “Take Photo” buttons/options used elsewhere.
	•	Ensure the new section fits neatly into the existing layout on desktop and mobile with no overlapping or broken layout.

4. No errors / blank screens

After implementing this:
	•	Make sure there are no JavaScript/TypeScript errors related to:
	•	The new upload field.
	•	State handling.
	•	Form submission logic.
	•	Ensure Step 3 and all other steps:
	•	Load correctly with no blank screens.
	•	Navigate forwards and backwards without issues.
	•	Confirm that:
	•	Submitting the form still works correctly.
	•	The backend receives all documents plus the new profile picture field without breaking existing behaviour.

Please do not change any other logic or UI outside of adding this new profile picture upload section on Step 3 and wiring it into the existing form flow.
