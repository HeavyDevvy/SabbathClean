# PROMPT FOR REPLIT – HOME PAGE UI + COLOUR UPDATE

You are working on the **home page only** of my existing web app in this Replit project.
Please implement ALL of the following changes without breaking any existing functionality (no errors, no blank screens).

---

## 1. Hero Image

- Replace the current top/hero picture on the home page with the image I have uploaded in this Replit project along with this prompt.
- Make sure it appears in the correct hero position and is responsive (looks good on desktop and mobile).

---

## 2. Strict Colour Palette (no other colours)

On the home page, the ONLY colours that may be used for CTAs, buttons, text (except inside images), icons, borders and backgrounds are:

- `#44062D` – deep plum (primary dark)
- `#3C0920` – wine / berry (secondary dark)
- `#EED1C4` – warm cream
- `#F7F2EF` – soft off-white / background
- `#C56B86` – muted rose accent

**Requirements:**

- Remove ALL old blues, purples, or any other colours from the home page UI (buttons, text, backgrounds, borders, icons, badges, etc.).
- Map the existing design to this palette:
  - **Backgrounds:** use `#F7F2EF` and `#EED1C4`.
  - **Headings / important text:** `#44062D` or `#3C0920`.
  - **Primary CTAs** (e.g. "Quick Quote", "Book Now"): `#C56B86` with proper hover state using a slightly lighter/darker variation of the same colour.
- Images themselves can keep their original colours, but no other UI element should use colours outside this palette.

## 3. Service Cards / Placeholders Clean-up

On all service cards or placeholders on the home page (e.g. House Cleaning, Outdoor, Specials, etc.):

**Remove the following elements completely:**

- "Same day"
- "Rated" / rating badges
- "Verified" labels
- "20km" or distance labels
- The discounts section (bulk day discounts etc.)

**In general:** Everything between the hourly rate and the "Quick Quote" / "Book Now" button must be removed on all service cards on the home page.

**Keep:**
- The title
- Short description (if present)
- Hourly rate
- The CTA button

Ensure the visual design of the cards aligns with the new colour palette and spacing.

---

## 4. Spacing & Layout

- Improve spacing between sections so the home page looks cleaner and more balanced:
  - Add consistent vertical padding between sections.
  - Ensure cards have consistent internal padding and are not cramped.
  - Avoid large empty gaps / wasted space while still keeping the design airy.
- The layout must remain responsive and work on different screen sizes.

---

## 5. Functionality

- Do not change any JavaScript logic or break any existing links/behaviour.
- All existing CTAs (Quick Quote, Book Now, etc.) must still work exactly as before and navigate to the correct pages/flows.

---

## 6. Verification Checklist (must be passed before finishing)

After making the changes, run through this checklist and fix anything that fails:

1. ✅ New hero image is visible, correctly placed, and responsive.
2. ✅ Only these 5 colours appear in the home page UI: `#44062D`, `#3C0920`, `#EED1C4`, `#F7F2EF`, `#C56B86`.
3. ✅ No old blue/purple colours remain on text, buttons, badges, or backgrounds.
4. ✅ On every service card:
   - "Same day", "Rated", "Verified", "20km", discount information, and all content between hourly rate and CTA button are removed.
   - The CTA buttons still work.
5. ✅ Section spacing looks balanced and there is no large wasted space or cramped content.
6. ✅ The app builds and runs with no error codes in the console.
7. ✅ The home page does not show a blank screen at any point.
8. ✅ All previous functionality on the home page still works as expected.

## 🔴 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

**BEFORE YOU START:**
1. Identify all files that control the home page (components, styles, CSS files).
2. Create a mental map of what needs to change in each file.

**WHILE IMPLEMENTING:**
1. Make changes **incrementally** - update one section at a time.
2. After each change, verify the app still runs without errors.
3. If you encounter an error, **stop and fix it immediately** before proceeding.
4. Test each colour change by searching the codebase for old colour values (blues, purples, etc.).
5. Use browser DevTools or inspect element to verify colours match the exact hex codes.

**SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Search for all instances of colour values in CSS/styling (look for `#`, `rgb`, `blue`, `purple`, etc.).
- Replace ALL colour references on the home page with the approved palette.
- For the hero image: locate the current image reference (likely in a `<img>` tag, CSS background, or component prop) and replace with the new filename exactly as uploaded.
- For service cards: identify the component/section that renders them, then remove the specified elements from the JSX/HTML structure.

**DO NOT:**
- Skip the verification checklist.
- Leave any placeholder comments like "// TODO: update colour" - make the actual change.
- Assume a change worked without testing it.
- Move to the next change if the current one breaks something.

**AFTER COMPLETING ALL CHANGES:**
1. Run the app and navigate to the home page.
2. Go through the verification checklist point by point.
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect elements and confirm colours.
4. Click all buttons to ensure functionality is preserved.
5. Test on mobile/responsive view.

Make all changes directly in this Replit project and keep the code clean and organized.

**If you encounter any issues or are unsure about a change, STOP and ask for clarification rather than proceeding with assumptions.**
