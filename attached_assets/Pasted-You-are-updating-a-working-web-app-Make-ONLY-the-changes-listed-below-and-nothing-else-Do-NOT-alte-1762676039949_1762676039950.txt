You are updating a working web app. Make ONLY the changes listed below and nothing else.
Do NOT alter any copy/wording, routes, API contracts, global styles, state structure, or unrelated components.
Preserve all existing behaviors outside the specified areas.

====================
OBJECTIVE
====================
1) Fix “Book services now” so it allows service selection (not defaulting to House Cleaning).
2) Implement “Add another service” flow exactly as described below.
3) Complete the remaining Payment step updates (per earlier spec).
4) Apply missing updates on the Booking Confirmation page (per earlier spec).
5) Verify that ALL previously requested changes are present and working as intended.
6) Produce a concise change report and pass the acceptance checklist at the end.

====================
AUDIT FIRST (REQUIRED)
====================
Before making changes:
- Detect the stack and locate the following (file path → component/function → line range):
  - Home page “Book services now” selection UI + step navigation handler(s).
  - Provider selection step and any “Add another service” logic or placeholders.
  - Booking flow: Payment step (summary, add-ons dropdown, totals, validation).
  - Booking Confirmation page component/template.
- Output a structured list of the targets you will modify. Then proceed to implement fixes.

====================
FIXES TO IMPLEMENT
====================

[1] HOME PAGE — SERVICE SELECTION
- Bug: “Book services now” only allows House Cleaning and ignores other choices.
- Fix:
  - Ensure the selection component correctly binds the chosen service ID/category to booking state.
  - Remove any hard-coded default forcing House Cleaning after “Next”.
  - If the blank screen after Add-ins was due to a null route/state, fix the handler while preserving route names and state shapes.
- Do NOT change labels, design system, or unrelated logic.

[2] ADD ANOTHER SERVICE — MULTI-SERVICE BOOKING (max 3)
- At the end of “Choose your verified provider” step, ensure a control labeled EXACTLY “Add another service” appears.
- Behavior when clicked:
  - Return user to the first booking step to select a new service.
  - Prevent selecting the same service again within the same booking session (hide or disable already-selected services).
  - Maintain a list of up to 3 distinct services (hard cap = 3).
  - Each added service must go through the same booking flow (including add-ons, schedule, provider).
  - Aggregate services so that Payment step shows each service with its own line items/add-ons, plus a single grand total.
- IMPORTANT:
  - Do not break existing single-service behavior.
  - Use existing state/store if present; if not, add a small scoped booking-session aggregator without changing global app patterns.

[3] PAYMENT STEP — COMPLETE REMAINING CHANGES
- Ensure the following are implemented and working:
  - Clear breakdown of add-ons (with prices) per service.
  - A dropdown above the total to add more add-ons; changes must update breakdown + total immediately.
  - Multi-service display: split by service with individual subtotals and one grand total.
  - Validation:
    - Bank select dropdown with SA banks:
      ["ABSA","FNB","Standard Bank","Nedbank","Capitec","Investec","African Bank","TymeBank","Discovery Bank","Bidvest Bank","Sasfin"]
    - Account number: numeric only; typical SA lengths 8–13 (configurable, warn on mismatch).
    - CVV: 3–4 digits.
    - Expiry: MM/YY format with inline validation.
  - Receipt download: ensure only ONE file per click; include all services and add-ons.
  - “Add to Calendar”: generate valid .ics for the full booking (all services, provider(s), address, scheduled date/time, add-ons in notes) and:
    - Email to the user’s registered email using the existing mailer, OR
    - If none exists, add a minimal server routine consistent with current stack. Also provide a fallback “Download .ics” link on success/fail.
- Do not add heavy dependencies; keep any new code minimal and scoped.

[4] BOOKING CONFIRMATION PAGE — APPLY MISSING UPDATES
- Ensure the confirmation page:
  - Uses the same global logo used on Booking Confirmed across the entire app.
  - Shows all services booked (single or multi-service) with add-ons and totals matching the Payment step.
  - Provides “Share booking” and “Add to Calendar” (the same .ics behavior as above).
- Maintain existing styling patterns; do not change unrelated content.

[5] PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED CHANGES — VERIFY & COMPLETE
Confirm (and implement if missing) the previously requested items:
- Demo modal (“Watch how it works”): single Play control only; one close X; remove misleading clickable elements.
- Emergency/Urgent/Same Day behavior:
  - Preferred date defaults to TODAY and is read-only.
  - Emergency time preference locked to “As soon as possible”.
- Add-ons & extras:
  - Comments field present.
  - Add-ons as dropdown with pricing per industry.
  - Keyword-based auto-suggest from comments (config-driven).
  - Hours auto-populated from industry standards (config-driven) with disclaimer:
    “The time spent on site is subject to change once the service provider assesses the scope of work on-site.”
- Provider step:
  - Remove booking summary from this page.
  - Provider names clickable → modal shows photo, rating, distance, ETA, bio.
- Services page “Book Now” flow matches Home booking flow (parity).
- Services page respects logged-in state (no sign-in/join prompts if already authenticated).
- Logo consistency: same logo everywhere; sized correctly per context.
- Receipt: single download; reflects all add-ons/services.

====================
CONFIG & DATA (SCOPED)
====================
- Keep any new configuration in a dedicated `/config` folder:
  - addons.json (per service/industry with {id, label, price})
  - keywords.json (keyword → addonId mapping; many-to-many allowed)
  - hours.json (industry standard hours per service/add-on)
  - banks.json (bank list + optional account pattern hints)
- Seed with reasonable placeholders and TODO comments; do NOT fetch external data.

====================
STRICT NON-GOALS
====================
- Do NOT change wording, font stacks, colors, or layout outside the components modified here.
- Do NOT alter routes, API contracts, DB schema, auth flows, or global providers.
- Do NOT introduce large new dependencies. Keep everything minimal and local to the flow.

====================
OUTPUT AFTER CHANGES
====================
Provide:
1) A list of all edited files with a one-line summary for each.
2) For critical fixes (service selection bug, add-another-service flow, payment summary, booking confirmation), show concise diffs or before/after snippets.
3) Note any small helper/config files you added under /config.

====================
ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
