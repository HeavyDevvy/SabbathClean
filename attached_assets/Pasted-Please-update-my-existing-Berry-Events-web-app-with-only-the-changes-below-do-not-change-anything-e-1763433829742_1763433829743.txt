Please update my existing Berry Events web app with only the changes below (do not change anything else in the project: UI, colors, layout, or unrelated logic).

All changes apply to the “My Bookings” page, where bookings are split into Upcoming Bookings and Past Bookings.

⸻

1. Auto-move past bookings from “Upcoming” to “Past”
	•	On the My Bookings page, ensure that any booking whose date and time are in the past (compared to the current date and time) is:
	•	Removed from “Upcoming Bookings”, and
	•	Displayed under “Past Bookings”.
	•	This logic must work:
	•	On initial page load.
	•	Whenever bookings are refreshed or re-fetched from the backend.
	•	Use the existing booking object’s date/time fields to determine whether a booking is in the past.
	•	Do not break any existing filters, sorting, or pagination (if they exist).

⸻

2. “Review your berry” button for each past booking

For each booking in the Past Bookings section, ensure there is an action button:
	•	Button text: “Review your berry”.

On click behaviour:

When the user clicks “Review your berry” for a past booking:
	1.	Open a popup/modal (reuse the existing modal/popup pattern used in the app; do not introduce a completely different style).
	2.	The popup must display:
	•	Service provider details for the provider used in that booking, including at least:
	•	Provider name (and any other info already stored, like profile picture, rating, etc., if available in the booking/provider object).
	•	A booking summary, including:
	•	Service type
	•	Date and time
	•	Duration / estimated hours
	•	Address / location
	•	Any add-ons, if they exist in the model
	•	Price or total amount, if this is already part of the booking data
	•	A star rating system:
	•	Maximum of 5 stars.
	•	User can select from 0 to 5 stars.
	•	“Worst” = no stars selected, “best” = 5 stars selected.
	•	An optional comments text area:
	•	Label: “Comments (optional)” or similar.
	•	Free-text input where the user can leave written feedback about their Berry / service.
	3.	When the user submits the review:
	•	If there’s already an API or function in the codebase for saving a review/rating, use it and send:
	•	The booking ID
	•	The service provider ID
	•	The selected star rating
	•	The optional comments text (can be empty or null if the user doesn’t type anything).
	•	If no such API exists yet, create a placeholder handler that:
	•	Stores the rating and comments in local state,
	•	Logs a clear message to the console (e.g. "TODO: send review and comments to backend"),
	•	Does not break anything else.

Make sure:
	•	Closing the popup returns the user cleanly to the My Bookings page.
	•	There are no console errors when opening, using, submitting, or closing the popup.

3. “Re-book” button for each past booking (CORRECTED LOGIC)

For each past booking, ensure there is an action button:
	•	Button text: “Re-book”.

Required behaviour:

When the user clicks “Re-book” on a past booking:
	1.	Identify the service type of that past booking (for example, House Cleaning, Catering, etc.).
	2.	The user must be taken directly into the booking steps for that specific service:
	•	Example:
If the past booking is for a cleaning service, then:
	•	The Re-book button for that booking must navigate to the cleaning service booking flow,
i.e. the same multi-step flow that would normally be used when booking that cleaning service from scratch.
	3.	Pre-populate fields from the past booking:
	•	All relevant booking fields should be pre-filled from the selected past booking, including (as applicable to your existing model):
	•	Service configuration (service type, package, etc.)
	•	Address / location
	•	Number of rooms / bathrooms
	•	Estimated hours / duration
	•	Any selected add-ons
	•	Special instructions / notes
	•	Any other configuration fields that were set on the original booking.
	•	Do NOT pre-populate the date and time.
	•	The date and time must be blank or reset so the user has to choose a new date and time.
	4.	The user must still be able to edit all pre-filled fields:
	•	Users can change any of the fields that were preloaded (address, add-ons, hours, notes, etc.).
	•	Date and time must be chosen again by the user in the flow.
	5.	Skip the “Select Service” step:
	•	The flow must skip any initial “select service” page.
	•	The service should be automatically set to the same service that was originally booked in that past booking.
	•	All other booking steps should behave exactly as they do for a normal booking of that service.
	6.	The technical implementation:
	•	You may reuse the existing navigation and state-handling logic used in the normal booking flow for each service, but:
	•	For Re-book, initialise the booking state using the past booking’s data (excluding date/time).
	•	After the user completes and confirms the re-booking:
	•	The new booking should behave exactly like a normal booking of that service.
	•	It should appear under Upcoming Bookings, assuming the new date/time is in the future.
	•	It must follow the same logic for later moving to Past Bookings once the new date/time has passed.

4. Quality and constraints
	•	Do not change:
	•	Any colors, fonts, or global styles.
	•	The layout or structure of pages other than what is strictly required for:
	•	The Review your berry popup comments field.
	•	The Re-book navigation and pre-population.
	•	Any unrelated components or pages.
	•	Ensure:
	•	No error codes, no uncaught exceptions, no blank screens.
	•	TypeScript/JavaScript compiles cleanly.
	•	Routing still works as before.

Quick checklist before you finish:
	1.	Past bookings are no longer visible under “Upcoming Bookings”.
	2.	All bookings in the past show up correctly under “Past Bookings”.
	3.	Each past booking has a working “Review your berry” button that opens a popup with:
	•	Correct service provider details.
	•	Correct booking summary.
	•	Working 0–5 star rating selector.
	•	An optional comments field that is included when saving or logged as TODO.
	4.	Each past booking has a working “Re-book” button that:
	•	Navigates to the correct service’s booking flow (e.g. cleaning service flow for a cleaning booking).
	•	Pre-populates all booking fields from the past booking except date and time.
	•	Allows the user to edit any pre-filled fields.
	•	Skips the service selection step.
	5.	The app runs with no console errors and no blank screens.

Please implement all of the above and only make changes necessary for this functionality.
