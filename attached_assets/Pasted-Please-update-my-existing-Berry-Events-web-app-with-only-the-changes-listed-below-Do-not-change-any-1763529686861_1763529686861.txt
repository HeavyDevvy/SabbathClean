Please update my existing Berry Events web app with only the changes listed below.
Do not change anything else in the project.
Make sure there are no error codes and no blank screens once the changes are made.

⸻

1. Update the look & feel of the downloaded booking receipt (booking summary)

Locate the downloaded receipt / booking summary (the file the user downloads after a booking is completed).

Keep all data the same
	•	Do not change:
	•	Any of the information shown on the receipt (booking details, customer details, pricing, totals, etc.).
	•	Any of the underlying data fields or values.
	•	Only update the visual design / styling.

⸻

2. Match the top of the receipt to the app header

Update the top section of the receipt so that it visually matches the main header of the web app.

Specifically:
	1.	Background colour:
	•	Set the background colour of the top section of the receipt to be the same colour as the app header background.
	2.	Logo:
	•	Add the same new logo that is used in the app header.
	•	Place the logo at the top of the receipt (for example, left-aligned or centred).
	•	Ensure:
	•	The logo is sized appropriately (clear and not pixelated).
	•	There is no visible box or different background around the logo — it should blend seamlessly with the receipt’s top background colour (same as the header).
	3.	Berry Events text:
	•	Add the “Berry Events” text next to or below the logo, using:
	•	The same or very similar font, size, weight, and colour as in the app header.
	•	The logo + “Berry Events” text should look like a branded header bar on the receipt, consistent with the website header.

⸻

3. General layout & readability
	•	Keep the rest of the receipt content (booking summary, line items, totals, dates, etc.) in the same structure as before.
	•	You may adjust:
	•	Minor spacing,
	•	Font sizes,
	•	Alignment
only as needed to keep the receipt clean and readable with the new top section.

4. Quality checks

Before completing, please confirm:
	1.	The top of the downloaded receipt:
	•	Uses the same background colour as the web app header.
	•	Shows the new logo used in the app header.
	•	Includes the “Berry Events” text in a style consistent with the header.
	2.	All receipt data is unchanged and still correct.
	3.	The receipt still downloads and opens correctly (PDF or file format unchanged).
	4.	The app runs with:
	•	No error codes in the console.
	•	No blank screens.
	•	No broken layouts introduced by these changes.

Please implement only the changes described above and keep everything else exactly as it is.
