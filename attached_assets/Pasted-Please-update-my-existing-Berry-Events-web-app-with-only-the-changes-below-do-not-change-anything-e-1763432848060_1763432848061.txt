Please update my existing Berry Events web app with only the changes below (do not change anything else in the project: UI, colors, layout, or unrelated logic).

Context

These changes all apply to the “My Bookings” page, where bookings are split into Upcoming Bookings and Past Bookings.

⸻

1. Auto-move past bookings from “Upcoming” to “Past”
	•	On the My Bookings page, ensure that any booking whose date and time are in the past (compared to the current date and time) is:
	•	Removed from “Upcoming Bookings”, and
	•	Displayed under “Past Bookings”.
	•	This logic should work:
	•	On initial page load.
	•	Whenever bookings are refreshed or re-fetched from the backend.
	•	Use the existing booking object’s date/time fields to determine whether a booking is in the past.
	•	Do not break any existing filters, sorting, or pagination (if they exist).

⸻

2. “Review your berry” button for each past booking

For each booking in the Past Bookings section, add an action button:
	•	Button text: “Review your berry”.

On click behaviour:

When the user clicks “Review your berry” for a past booking:
	1.	Open a popup/modal (use the existing modal/popup pattern used in the app if one already exists — do not invent a completely new style).
	2.	The popup must display:
	•	Service provider details for the provider used in that booking, including at least:
	•	Provider name (and any other info already stored, like profile picture, rating, etc., if available in the booking/provider object).
	•	A booking summary, including:
	•	Service type
	•	Date and time
	•	Duration / estimated hours
	•	Address / location
	•	Any add-ons, if they exist in the model
	•	Price or total amount if this is already part of the booking data
	•	A star rating system:
	•	Maximum of 5 stars.
	•	User can select from 0 to 5 stars.
	•	“Worst” should effectively be no stars selected, and “best” is 5 stars selected.
	3.	When the user selects a rating and confirms:
	•	If there’s already an API or function in the codebase for saving a review/rating, use it and send:
	•	The booking ID
	•	The service provider ID
	•	The selected star rating
	•	If no such API exists yet, create a placeholder handler that:
	•	Stores the rating in local state,
	•	Logs a clear message to the console (e.g. "TODO: send review to backend"),
	•	Does not break anything else.

Make sure:
	•	Closing the popup returns the user cleanly to the My Bookings page.
	•	There are no console errors when opening, using, or closing the popup.

3. “Re-book” button for each past booking

For each past booking, add another action button:
	•	Button text: “Re-book”.

Logic:

When the user clicks “Re-book” on a past booking:
	1.	Reuse the same navigation and state-prefill logic currently used by the “Book Now” button on the My Profile page:
	•	Find the existing function/handler used by “Book Now” on My Profile.
	•	Create a similar flow, but for re-booking from the My Bookings page.
	2.	For the selected past booking:
	•	Preload all booking details into the booking flow:
	•	Service type
	•	Address/location
	•	Number of rooms / hours / add-ons / special notes (or any other fields you use in the booking model)
	•	Any other configuration fields used when the original booking was created.
	•	The user must be able to edit all pre-filled fields before confirming the new booking.
	3.	Skip the “Select Service” step:
	•	The booking flow should default the service to the exact same service that was originally booked for that past booking.
	•	Do not show the “select service” page/step again for this rebooking flow.
	•	The rest of the booking steps should work exactly as they do in the current “Book Now” flow.
	4.	After rebooking:
	•	The new booking must behave exactly like any normal booking created via “Book Now”.
	•	It should appear correctly in Upcoming Bookings (assuming the new date/time is in the future) and follow the same logic for moving to Past Bookings once its date/time has passed.

⸻

4. Quality and constraints
	•	Do not change:
	•	Any colors, fonts, or global styles.
	•	The layout or structure of pages other than what is strictly required for the buttons and popup.
	•	Any unrelated components or pages.
	•	Ensure:
	•	No error codes, no uncaught exceptions, no blank screens.
	•	TypeScript/JavaScript compiles cleanly.
	•	Routing still works as before.

Quick checklist before you finish:
	1.	Past bookings are no longer visible under “Upcoming Bookings”.
	2.	All bookings in the past show up correctly under “Past Bookings”.
	3.	Each past booking has:
	•	A working “Review your berry” button that opens a popup with:
	•	Correct service provider details.
	•	Correct booking summary.
	•	Working 0–5 star rating selector.
	4.	Each past booking has:
	•	A working “Re-book” button that:
	•	Opens the booking flow.
	•	Preloads the selected booking’s details.
	•	Skips the service selection step.
	•	Uses the same behaviour as “Book Now” on the My Profile page.
	5.	The app runs with no console errors and no blank screens.

Please implement all of the above and only make changes necessary for this functionality.
