## CRITICAL: READ THE SCREENSHOT FIRST
I have attached a screenshot showing the exact section that needs to be changed. Look at it carefully before making any changes.

### What the Screenshot Shows:
The screenshot shows the top navigation bar/header section of my web app. This is the section that needs to be updated. Pay close attention to:
- The background colour of the navigation bar
- The size of the logo
- Any borders or frames around the header
- The user profile icon/avatar and its colours

---

## REQUIRED CHANGES - ALL MUST BE COMPLETED

### 1. BACKGROUND COLOUR CHANGE
**Current state:** The top navigation bar has a background colour that doesn't match our palette  
**Required change:** Change the navigation bar background colour to one of our approved colours:
- Use `#F7F2EF` (soft off-white) OR `#EED1C4` (warm cream) for a light background
- OR use `#44062D` (deep plum) if you want a dark header

**How to do this:**
1. Find the navigation/header component (likely named Header.jsx, Navbar.jsx, Navigation.jsx, or similar)
2. Locate the background colour property (could be in inline styles, CSS class, or Tailwind class)
3. Replace the current colour with one of the approved colours above
4. Save the file
5. **VERIFY:** Refresh the preview and check the header background changed

---

### 2. INCREASE LOGO SIZE
**Current state:** The logo is too small  
**Required change:** Make the logo significantly larger (at least 1.5x to 2x current size)

**How to do this:**
1. Find where the logo image is rendered in the header component
2. Look for width/height properties (could be `width="40"`, `className="w-10"`, or CSS styles)
3. Increase the size:
   - If it's a number value like `width={40}`, increase to `width={80}` or `width={100}`
   - If it's Tailwind like `w-10`, change to `w-20` or `w-24`
   - If it's CSS, increase the width/height values
4. Make sure the logo maintains its aspect ratio (don't make it distorted)
5. Save the file
6. **VERIFY:** Refresh the preview and check the logo is visibly larger

---

### 3. REMOVE BORDER/FRAME
**Current state:** There's a border or frame around the navigation bar  
**Required change:** Remove any borders, frames, or dividing lines on the navigation bar

**How to do this:**
1. In the header component, look for:
   - `border` property
   - `border-bottom` property  
   - Tailwind classes like `border`, `border-b`, `border-t`
   - Box shadow that creates a frame effect: `shadow`, `box-shadow`
2. Remove or set to `none`/`0`:
   - CSS: `border: none;` or remove the border property
   - Tailwind: remove classes like `border`, `border-b-2`, `shadow-md`
3. Save the file
4. **VERIFY:** Refresh the preview and check no border/frame is visible

---

### 4. USER LOGO/ICON COLOUR ALIGNMENT
**Current state:** The user profile icon/logo doesn't match our colour scheme  
**Required change:** Update the user icon colour to match our approved palette

**What to look for:**
- User avatar icon
- Profile icon
- Account icon
- User menu button

**How to do this:**
1. Find the user icon element in the header component
2. Check its colour properties:
   - If it's an icon component: look for `color`, `fill`, or `stroke` props
   - If it's using Tailwind: look for classes like `text-blue-500`, `fill-purple-600`
3. Change to an approved colour:
   - For icon color: use `#44062D`, `#3C0920`, or `#C56B86`
   - Tailwind equivalent: remove any blue/purple classes
4. If there's a background or border on the user icon, update those too
5. Save the file
6. **VERIFY:** Refresh preview and check the user icon matches colour scheme

---

## APPROVED COLOUR PALETTE (ONLY USE THESE)
- `#44062D` – deep plum (primary dark)
- `#3C0920` – wine / berry (secondary dark)  
- `#EED1C4` – warm cream
- `#F7F2EF` – soft off-white / background
- `#C56B86` – muted rose accent

---

## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: LOCATE THE HEADER COMPONENT
1. Look in your project files for the header/navigation component
2. Common locations:
   - `/components/Header.jsx`
   - `/components/Navbar.jsx`
   - `/components/Navigation.jsx`
   - `/components/layout/Header.jsx`
   - Or check the main app/layout file for inline header code

**Once found, write down the filename here:** ________________

### STEP 3: ERROR CHECKING

After making ALL changes:

1. **Check the browser console:**
   - Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
   - Go to Console tab
   - Are there any red error messages? 
   - **If YES:** Fix them before proceeding
   - **If NO:** Continue to next step

2. **Check for blank screens:**
   - Is the page displaying correctly?
   - Can you see the header/navigation?
   - Can you see the rest of the page content?
   - **If anything is blank:** Undo your last change and debug

3. **Check functionality:**
   - Click the logo - does it work?
   - Click the user icon - does it open a menu?
   - Click navigation links - do they work?
   - **If anything is broken:** Fix it before completing

---

### STEP 4: RESPONSIVE CHECK

Test the header at different screen sizes:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click the device toolbar icon (toggle device toolbar)
3. Test these sizes:
   - Mobile (375px) - Does the header look good?
   - Tablet (768px) - Does the header look good?
   - Desktop (1920px) - Does the header look good?
   - Is the logo size appropriate at all sizes?

**If anything looks broken at any size:** Adjust the sizes/spacing to be responsive

2. ✅ Open the AI chat in Replit
3. ✅ Click the upload button and attach your screenshot
4. ✅ Paste this entire prompt into the chat
5. ✅ Press Enter

### Step 3: Monitor the AI's Response
**Watch for these red flags:**
- ❌ AI says "I've updated" without showing the response format → **Reject this response**
- ❌ AI doesn't mention specific file names → **Reject this response**
- ❌ AI doesn't list old vs new values → **Reject this response**
- ❌ AI says "should work now" without verification → **Reject this response**

**If you see a red flag, respond with:**
```
You did not follow the mandatory response format. Please make the changes 
and respond using the EXACT format specified in the prompt, including:
- Specific file names and line numbers
- Old values vs new values for each change
- Visual verification checkmarks
- Error checking results
Start over and follow the format exactly.
```

### Step 4: Verify the Changes Yourself
Once the AI responds with the proper format:

1. ✅ Look at the preview - do you see the changes?
2. ✅ Check the background colour - does it match the palette?
3. ✅ Check the logo - is it bigger?
4. ✅ Check for borders - are they gone?
5. ✅ Check the user icon - does it match the colour scheme?
6. ✅ Click around - does everything still work?

**If anything is still wrong, respond with:**
```
I can still see [specific issue]. Please fix this specific issue:
[Describe exactly what's still wrong]

Use the mandatory response format to show what you changed.
```
