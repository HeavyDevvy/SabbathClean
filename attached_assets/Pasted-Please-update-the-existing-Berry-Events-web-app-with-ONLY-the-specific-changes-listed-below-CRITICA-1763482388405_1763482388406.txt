Please update the existing Berry Events web app with ONLY the specific changes listed below.
CRITICAL: Do not modify any other aspects of the project. Test thoroughly to ensure zero error codes and no blank screens after implementation.

1. Reduce Logo and Header Height
Logo Resizing:

Reduce the logo size to 50% of its current dimensions (both width and height)
Maintain aspect ratio to prevent distortion

Header Height Adjustment:

After resizing the logo, reduce the header height to be just tall enough to accommodate the new logo size
Add minimal padding (e.g., 8-12px top and bottom) to prevent a cramped appearance
Remove any excess vertical space

Requirements:

Logo must remain vertically centered within the new header
All header elements must remain properly aligned
Header should feel balanced, not cramped or stretched


2. Proportionally Scale Header Text and Icons
Objective: Create visual harmony between the smaller logo and all other header elements.
Elements to Adjust:

Navigation menu text
All header icons (menu icon, profile icon, etc.)
Any other text in the header

Guidelines:

Scale these elements so they visually complement the new logo size
Maintain readability - text should not be too small
Ensure vertical alignment is preserved
All elements should appear balanced and proportional

Suggested approach: If logo is reduced by 50%, consider reducing text/icons by approximately 20-30% (adjust based on visual balance)

3. Update "Quick Quote or Book Now" Button Styling
Important: This is a SINGLE button with the text "Quick quote or Book Now" (or similar wording).
Changes Required:

Apply the exact same styling currently used by the "Watch how it works" button:

Background color
Text color
Border style
Border radius
Padding
Font size/weight
Hover effects
Active/focus states



Implementation:

Reuse the same CSS class or styled-component used by "Watch how it works"
OR copy all CSS properties from that button to this button
DO NOT change the button text - only update the visual styling

Locations to update:

Homepage
Any other pages where this button appears


4. Pre-Deployment Quality Checklist
Before marking this task complete, verify ALL of the following:
Visual Checks:

 Logo is exactly 50% of its original size
 Header height is reduced and looks clean (not cramped or excessive)
 Logo is vertically centered in the new header
 Header text size is proportional to the new logo
 Header icons size is proportional to the new logo
 All header elements are properly aligned
 "Quick quote or Book Now" button matches "Watch how it works" button styling exactly

Technical Checks:

 No console errors in browser DevTools
 No blank/white screens on any page
 All pages load successfully
 No broken layouts or overlapping elements
 No missing images or assets
 Responsive design still works (test mobile/tablet views)
 All navigation links still function
 Button hover effects work correctly

Cross-Browser Check (if possible):

 Test in Chrome/Edge
 Test in Firefox
 Test in Safari (if available)


Implementation Notes
Approach:

Start with the logo resize and header height adjustment
Test and ensure no layout breaks
Adjust header text and icon sizes proportionally
Test again
Update button styling
Run final comprehensive tests

If errors occur:

Check for hard-coded pixel values that may need updating
Verify CSS specificity isn't causing style conflicts
Ensure no JavaScript depends on previous header dimensions
Check for any z-index or positioning issues

Preserve:

All existing functionality
All existing content
All other styling
All other components


Remember: Only make the changes specified above. Do not refactor, optimize, or "improve" other parts of the codebase.
