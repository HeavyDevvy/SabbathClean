Task: Implement Booking Cancellation Process with Refund Policy
Objective:
Create a complete cancellation workflow for bookings in the "Upcoming Bookings" section with a refund policy based on cancellation timing.
Requirements:

Cancellation Button & Pop-up:

When a user clicks "Cancel" on an upcoming booking, display a cancellation pop-up modal
The pop-up should include a text field/textarea for the user to provide a reason for cancellation (required field)


Refund Policy Display:

Display the following refund policy in bold red text within the pop-up:

Any cancellation: 10% will be deducted from the amount paid and will be paid to the service provider
Cancellations made 4 days or less before the booking: 50% will be deducted from the amount paid
Cancellations made 24 hours or less before the booking: No refund will be issued




Consent Mechanism:

Include a checkbox with text: "I agree to the cancellation terms and refund policy"
The user MUST tick this checkbox to proceed
The "Confirm Cancellation" button should be disabled until the checkbox is ticked
User must also provide a cancellation reason before proceeding


Cancellation Logic:

Calculate the appropriate refund amount based on the time between cancellation and booking date
Process the refund according to the policy outlined above
Update the booking status to "Cancelled"
Record the cancellation reason and timestamp


Post-Cancellation:

Once cancellation is confirmed, immediately move the booking from "Upcoming Bookings" to "Past Bookings" section
Display the booking with "Cancelled" status and refund information in Past Bookings


Quality Assurance:

Ensure there are no error codes or blank screens throughout the process
Test the complete cancellation flow from start to finish
Verify all other existing functionality remains unchanged and working
Ensure the cancellation pop-up closes properly after completion



Expected User Flow:
User clicks "Cancel" → Pop-up appears with refund policy and reason field → User enters reason → User reads policy (in bold red) → User ticks consent checkbox → User clicks "Confirm Cancellation" → Booking moves to Past Bookings with cancelled status
Please implement this functionality while preserving all existing features and ensuring no errors occur.
