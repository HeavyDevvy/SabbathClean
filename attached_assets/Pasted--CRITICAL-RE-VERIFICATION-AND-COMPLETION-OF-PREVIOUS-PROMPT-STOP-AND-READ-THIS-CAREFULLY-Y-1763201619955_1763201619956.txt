# 🔴 CRITICAL: RE-VERIFICATION AND COMPLETION OF PREVIOUS PROMPT

## STOP AND READ THIS CAREFULLY

You previously received instructions to update the home page. However, **multiple changes from that prompt have NOT been completed**. 

**DO NOT tell me you're done until EVERY single requirement below is verified and completed.**

---

## MANDATORY RE-VERIFICATION PROCESS

You MUST go through each requirement below and **actually check the live frontend** (not just the code). For each item, you must:

1. Open the app preview
2. Visually inspect the home page
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect elements
4. Verify the change was actually made
5. If NOT done, make the change NOW

---

## CHECKLIST - VERIFY EACH ITEM ON THE ACTUAL FRONTEND

### ✅ 1. HERO IMAGE
- [ ] Open the home page in preview
- [ ] Can you see the NEW hero image that was uploaded?
- [ ] Is it in the correct position at the top of the page?
- [ ] Does it look good on desktop view?
- [ ] Does it look good on mobile/tablet view?

**If ANY answer is NO:** Find where the hero image is rendered and replace it with the uploaded image file NOW.

---

### ✅ 2. COLOUR PALETTE - EXHAUSTIVE CHECK

**You must check EVERY visible element on the home page:**

#### A. Check ALL Buttons:
- [ ] Inspect every button on the home page (Quick Quote, Book Now, Learn More, etc.)
- [ ] Use DevTools to check the background colour
- [ ] Is it `#C56B86` or another approved colour?
- [ ] Check hover states - are they using approved colours?
- [ ] Are there ANY buttons still using blue, purple, or other colours?

**If ANY button uses a non-approved colour:** Update it NOW.

- [ ] Main headings - are they `#44062D` or `#3C0920`?
- [ ] Subheadings - approved colours?
- [ ] Body text - approved colours?
- [ ] Any link text - approved colours?

**If ANY text uses non-approved colours:** Update it NOW.

- [ ] Section backgrounds - are they `#F7F2EF` or `#EED1C4`?
- [ ] Card backgrounds - approved colours?
- [ ] Any overlay backgrounds - approved colours?

**If ANY background uses non-approved colours:** Update it NOW.

#### D. Check ALL Borders, Icons, Badges:
- [ ] Inspect every border on cards, sections, dividers
- [ ] Check every icon colour
- [ ] Check any badge backgrounds/text
- [ ] Are ALL of these using approved colours?

**If ANY use non-approved colours:** Update them NOW.

#### E. Final Colour Sweep:
- [ ] Use DevTools to inspect random elements across the page
- [ ] Look for any hint of blue, purple, teal, or other colours
- [ ] Check dropdown menus, tooltips, or hidden elements

**APPROVED COLOURS ONLY:**
- `#44062D` (deep plum)

### ✅ 3. SERVICE CARDS - ELEMENT REMOVAL

**For EVERY service card on the home page (House Cleaning, Outdoor, Specials, etc.):**

- [ ] Can you see "Same day" text? → **MUST BE REMOVED**
- [ ] Can you see "Rated" or rating badges? → **MUST BE REMOVED**
- [ ] Can you see "Verified" labels? → **MUST BE REMOVED**
- [ ] Can you see "20km" or distance labels? → **MUST BE REMOVED**
- [ ] Can you see discount information (bulk discounts, etc.)? → **MUST BE REMOVED**

**What SHOULD remain on each card:**
- Service title
- Short description (if present)
- Hourly rate
- CTA button (Quick Quote/Book Now)

**Check EVERY SINGLE CARD individually:**
- [ ] Card 1 - all unwanted elements removed?
- [ ] Card 2 - all unwanted elements removed?
- [ ] Card 3 - all unwanted elements removed?
- [ ] Continue for ALL cards...

**If ANY card still shows these elements:** Remove them from the component NOW.

---

### ✅ 4. SPACING & LAYOUT

- [ ] Scroll through the entire home page
- [ ] Is there consistent vertical spacing between sections?
- [ ] Are cards properly spaced with adequate padding?
- [ ] Is there any cramped content that needs more breathing room?
- [ ] Are there any huge gaps that waste space?
- [ ] Does the page look balanced and clean?

**If spacing looks off:** Adjust padding/margins NOW.

---

### ✅ 5. FUNCTIONALITY TEST

**Click through EVERY interactive element:**

- [ ] Click "Quick Quote" on each service card - does it work?
- [ ] Click "Book Now" on each service card - does it work?
- [ ] Click any navigation links - do they work?
- [ ] Try any dropdowns or interactive elements - do they work?
- [ ] Check browser console - are there ANY errors?

**If ANYTHING is broken:** Fix it NOW before proceeding.

---

### ✅ 6. RESPONSIVE CHECK

- [ ] Open DevTools responsive design mode
- [ ] Test mobile view (375px width)
- [ ] Test tablet view (768px width)
- [ ] Test desktop view (1920px width)
- [ ] Does everything look good at all sizes?
- [ ] Is the hero image responsive?
- [ ] Are cards stacking properly on mobile?

**If responsive design is broken:** Fix it NOW.

---

## 🔴 BEFORE YOU TELL ME YOU'RE DONE

**Complete this final verification:**

1. **Screenshot test:** If I took a screenshot of the home page right now:
   - Would I see the new hero image?
   - Would I see ONLY the 5 approved colours?
   - Would the service cards be clean (no ratings, distance, etc.)?
   - Would spacing look professional?

2. **Code search test:**
   - Search your CSS/styling files for old colour hex codes
   - Search for "blue", "purple", "#3b82f6", "rgb(", etc.
   - Did you replace ALL instances on the home page?

3. **Component check:**
   - Open the service card component
   - Can you still see code that renders "Same day", "Rated", "Verified", "20km", discounts?
   - If YES, you're NOT done - remove that code NOW
