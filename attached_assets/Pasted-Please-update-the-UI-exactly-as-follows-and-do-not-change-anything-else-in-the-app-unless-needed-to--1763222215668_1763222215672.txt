Please update the UI exactly as follows and do not change anything else in the app unless needed to prevent errors:
	1.	Berry Stars Section Styling
	•	Locate the section on the page labelled “Berry stars” (the component / div / section that renders this heading and its content).
	•	Wrap this entire section in a clearly defined container (if it is not already in one) so that the styling applies only to the Berry stars block.
	•	Add a visible border around the Berry stars section:
	•	Use a border style that fits the existing design (e.g. 1px or 2px solid).
	•	Use a colour from the existing colour scheme used in the app (do not introduce any brand-new colours).
	•	Change the background colour of the Berry stars section:
	•	Use a different colour from the existing colour scheme (one that is already used in the app’s palette).
	•	Ensure this background colour is clearly different from the main page background so the Berry stars block stands out.
	•	Make sure the text inside the Berry stars section is still easy to read and has good contrast on the new background.
	2.	Responsiveness & Layout
	•	Ensure the updated Berry stars section still looks good on:
	•	Desktop / larger screens
	•	Tablet sizes
	•	Mobile screens
	•	The new border and background must not break the layout, overlap other sections, or cause horizontal scrolling.
	3.	Code Quality & Stability
	•	Make sure there are no error codes, no warnings in the console related to this change, and no blank screens.
	•	If using React or a similar framework, ensure:
	•	No invalid JSX or missing imports.
	•	No keys or props errors introduced by the change.
	•	Keep the code clean and consistent with the existing coding style (class names, Tailwind/inline styles/CSS modules, etc., depending on what the project already uses).
	4.	Acceptance Checklist (Replit, please verify before finishing)
	•	The Berry stars section now has a clear border using a colour from the existing colour scheme.
	•	The Berry stars section has a background colour that is different from the main page background but still from the existing colour scheme.
	•	Text and icons inside the Berry stars section remain fully readable and accessible.
	•	The layout is not broken on desktop, tablet, or mobile; no unwanted overflow or misalignment.
	•	There are no new console errors or warnings caused by this change.
	•	The app runs without any blank screens or crashes.
	•	No other sections or components were unintentionally changed.

Please implement these changes and then show me the updated code for the Berry stars section (component / HTML / JSX) so I can review it.
