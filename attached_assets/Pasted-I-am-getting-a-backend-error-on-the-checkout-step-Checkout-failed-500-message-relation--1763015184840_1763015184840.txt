I am getting a backend error on the checkout step:

"Checkout failed
500: {\"message\":\"relation \\\"booking_gate_codes\\\" does not exist\"}"

This means the backend is trying to read/write from a table called booking_gate_codes that does not exist. Please fix ONLY what is necessary to make checkout work end-to-end, and do not change anything else in the app unless it directly relates to this error.

Required actions:

1) Find the source of the error
- Search the codebase for any references to "booking_gate_codes".
- List the files, functions and lines where this table name is used (controllers, services, models, migrations, SQL, etc).
- Confirm which database is being used (e.g. Postgres/Prisma/ORM) and how migrations are handled.

2) Fix the missing table / schema issue
- If the application is clearly designed to use a booking_gate_codes table (for storing booking codes, OTPs, or similar), then:
  - Create the appropriate model/schema/migration for booking_gate_codes with the fields required by the existing code (infer column names and types from how it is queried and written).
  - Run/apply the migration or ensure it is included in the project’s migration flow so the table exists when the app runs.
- If the table name is a mistake (e.g. it should be something like booking_gate_code or booking_gatecodes or another existing table), then:
  - Correct the table name in the queries/models to match the actual existing table name used elsewhere in the code.
- Do NOT guess a completely different design. Use the existing code and database schema to infer the correct structure or correct name.

3) Keep business logic and UX the same
- Do not change any of the booking flow logic except what is required to fix this specific error.
- Do not change pricing, fees, totals, or how the Payment Summary is calculated.
- Do not change any UI text, colors, or layout outside of what is absolutely necessary to get past this error.

4) After fixing the table/schema or name, make sure the payment flow works as intended:
- When I enter valid card or bank account details and click “Complete Payment”:
  - The backend should no longer throw a 500 error about booking_gate_codes.
  - The booking and any related gate/confirmation codes should be saved correctly.
  - I should be redirected to the Booking Summary / Booking Complete page that shows the details of the booking.

5) Error handling
- If payment fails for a real validation reason (e.g. invalid card, missing field), show a clear, user-friendly error message on the UI instead of a raw 500 or raw JSON message.
- Log technical details only on the server side, not in the UI.

6) Do NOT:
- Do not remove the payment feature.
- Do not remove or bypass database writes just to hide the error.
- Do not change any other tables, routes, or business logic that are unrelated to booking_gate_codes.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely required; prefer using the existing database/ORM setup.

7) Final checklist (run and confirm each item):
[ ] No 500 error mentioning "booking_gate_codes" when clicking Complete Payment.
[ ] A new booking record (and any associated gate/confirmation code record, if applicable) is created successfully in the database.
[ ] After successful payment, the user is redirected to the Booking Summary / Booking Complete page.
[ ] The Payment Summary values (subtotal, fees, total) are unchanged and remain correct.
[ ] No new console errors in the browser.
[ ] No new errors in the server logs related to this change.
[ ] No other parts of the app have been modified beyond what is required to fix this issue.

After you implement the fix, please output:
- The list of files edited.
- A short explanation of what you changed in each file.
- Whether you added a migration or altered an existing one, and how to apply it if needed.
